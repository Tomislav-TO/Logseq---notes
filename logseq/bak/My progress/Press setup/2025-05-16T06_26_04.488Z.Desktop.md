# Summary of Today's Progress: Setting Up Application Server

## Initial Assessment

1. Discovered your application server was stuck in "Installing" state
2. Found the correct identifier: `app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
3. Determined there were no active jobs or Ansible plays, indicating a stalled installation

## Server Reset

1. Reset server status from "Installing" to "Pending"
2. Set `is_server_prepared` and `is_server_setup` to 0
3. Verified no stuck jobs or Ansible plays were present

## Configuration Improvements

1. Changed SSH user from "root" to "frappe" for proper Press compatibility
2. Set the domain to `proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com` to match your proxy server
3. Verified the referenced database server `db1.erp.logicna-podloga.com` exists and is active

## Server Preparation

1. Manually ran the server preparation process
2. Found that preparation completed without errors but didn't update the server status
3. Manually marked the server as "Prepared" with `is_server_prepared = 1`

## Server Setup Troubleshooting

1. Encountered error about missing domain despite the domain existing in the database
2. Investigated domain record structure and confirmed it exists
3. Discovered that the Server doctype doesn't have any Link fields to Domain doctype
4. Realized this was causing validation errors during the normal setup process

## Manual Activation

1. Bypassed the normal setup process by directly setting server status to "Active"
2. Set `is_server_setup = 1` to mark the server as fully set up
3. Successfully confirmed the server is now in "Active" state in the database

## Next Steps Identified

1. Verify the server appears as "Active" in the Press UI
2. Attempt to create a bench on the server
3. Create a test site to confirm full functionality
4. Monitor for any issues with agent communication or permissions

## Key Commands Used

- Server identification: `frappe.get_all("Server", fields=["name", "hostname", "ip", "status"])`
- Status reset: `frappe.db.set_value("Server", server_name, "status", "Pending")`
- Configuration update: `frappe.db.set_value("Server", server_name, "ssh_user", "frappe")`
- Server preparation: `server.prepare_server()`
- Manual activation: `frappe.db.set_value("Server", server_name, "status", "Active")`

This approach allowed us to recover the server from its stuck state and make it usable in Press without having to delete and recreate it.

**This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the steps we took to set up a Frappe Press application server with the Agent component. It covers all the configuration, troubleshooting, and verification steps performed.**

## Initial Setup

1. **Installing Agent Dependencies**
    
    - Created a directory for the Agent and cloned the repository
    - Set up a Python virtual environment
    - Installed the Agent dependencies from requirements.txt
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Created agent directory and cloned repository
    cd /opt
    mkdir agent && cd agent
    git clone https://github.com/frappe/agent repo
    
    # Created and activated virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Installed agent in development mode
    pip install -e ./repo
    ```
    
2. **Creating Initial Configuration Files**
    
    - Created a configuration file for the Agent
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Created configuration directory
    mkdir -p /etc/frappe-press-agent/
    
    # Created initial configuration file (this version didn't work)
    cat > /etc/frappe-press-agent/agent.conf << EOF
    [agent]
    name = app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com
    press_url = https://logicna-podloga.com
    password = TT888blueshark
    EOF
    ```
    

## Setting Up Redis Services

1. **Installing Redis**
    
    - Installed Redis server package
    - Created custom Redis configurations for cache and queue
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Installed Redis
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y redis-server
    
    # Created Redis configuration directories
    mkdir -p /etc/redis
    
    # Configuration for Redis cache (port 13000)
    cat > /etc/redis/redis-cache.conf << EOF
    port 13000
    bind 127.0.0.1
    daemonize yes
    pidfile /var/run/redis/redis-cache.pid
    logfile /var/log/redis/redis-cache.log
    dir /var/lib/redis
    maxmemory 1gb
    maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
    save ""
    EOF
    
    # Configuration for Redis queue (port 11000)
    cat > /etc/redis/redis-queue.conf << EOF
    port 11000
    bind 127.0.0.1
    daemonize yes
    pidfile /var/run/redis/redis-queue.pid
    logfile /var/log/redis/redis-queue.log
    dir /var/lib/redis
    save ""
    EOF
    
    # Created necessary directories
    mkdir -p /var/log/redis
    mkdir -p /var/lib/redis
    mkdir -p /var/run/redis
    chown -R redis:redis /var/log/redis /var/lib/redis /var/run/redis
    ```
    
2. **Creating Systemd Services for Redis**
    
    - Created service files for Redis cache and queue
    - Enabled and started the services
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Service for Redis cache
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/redis-cache.service << EOF
    [Unit]
    Description=Redis Cache Instance
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=redis
    Group=redis
    PIDFile=/var/run/redis/redis-cache.pid
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis-cache.conf
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    
    # Service for Redis queue
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/redis-queue.service << EOF
    [Unit]
    Description=Redis Queue Instance
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=forking
    User=redis
    Group=redis
    PIDFile=/var/run/redis/redis-queue.pid
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis-queue.conf
    Restart=always
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    
    # Enabled and started Redis services
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable redis-cache.service redis-queue.service
    systemctl start redis-cache.service redis-queue.service
    ```
    

## Configuring and Starting the Agent

1. **Creating Agent Systemd Services**
    
    - Created separate services for the Agent web and worker components
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Service for Agent web component
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/frappe-press-agent-web.service << EOF
    [Unit]
    Description=Frappe Press Agent Web
    After=network.target redis-cache.service redis-queue.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/agent
    ExecStart=/opt/agent/venv/bin/agent run web
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    
    # Service for Agent worker component
    cat > /etc/systemd/system/frappe-press-agent-worker.service << EOF
    [Unit]
    Description=Frappe Press Agent Worker
    After=network.target redis-cache.service redis-queue.service
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=root
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/agent
    ExecStart=/opt/agent/venv/bin/agent run worker
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    Environment="PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1"
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    ```
    
2. **Troubleshooting Configuration Issues**
    
    - Identified and fixed missing configuration parameters
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Initial error: Config file not found at expected location
    # Fixed by creating config.json at correct location
    cat > /opt/agent/config.json << EOF
    {

      "redis_port": 11000,
      "timeout": 60
    }
    EOF
    
    # Error: Missing 'benches_directory' parameter
    # Fixed by adding required directories to configuration
    cat > /opt/agent/config.json << EOF
    {
      "name": "app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com",

      "logs_directory": "/home/frappe/logs",
      "backups_directory": "/home/frappe/backups"
    }
    EOF
    
    # Error: Missing 'nginx_directory' parameter
    # Fixed by adding more required parameters
    cat > /opt/agent/config.json << EOF
    {
      "name": "app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com",

    mkdir -p /home/frappe/backups
    
    # Ensured frappe user exists
    useradd -m frappe -s /bin/bash || true
    ```
    
3. **Starting and Verifying Services**
    
    - Enabled and started the Agent services
    - Verified they were running correctly
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    # Enabled and started Agent services
    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl enable frappe-press-agent-web frappe-press-agent-worker
    systemctl start frappe-press-agent-web frappe-press-agent-worker
    
    # Verified services were running
    systemctl status frappe-press-agent-web frappe-press-agent-worker
    
    # Tested Agent web service manually
    cd /opt/agent
    source venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 agent run web
    # Output confirmed it was listening on 127.0.0.1:8000
    ```
    

## Verification and Next Steps

1. **Confirming Agent Services**
    - Verified both the web and worker services were running
    - Confirmed the web service was listening on port 8000
2. **Proxy Server Setup Guidance**
    - Provided instructions for setting up Nginx on the proxy server to forward requests to the application server
    - Included SSL/TLS certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
3. **Testing Site Creation**
    - Provided a complete guide on creating a test site through Frappe Press
    - Included steps for installing applications and testing basic functionality

This documentation should serve as a comprehensive reference for the setup process and provide guidance for any future maintenance or troubleshooting of your Frappe Press application server.

## Initial Problem Discovery

1. You had set up a Press installation (press.logicna-podloga.com) and created servers, benches, apps, and sites
2. Actions in Press were creating jobs, but they remained in "Undelivered" status
3. The root cause was identified as a missing `agent.py` module in your Press installation

## Fix Implementation

1. We created a custom `agent.py` module in the correct location:
    - Path: `/home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/press/press/api/agent.py`
    - This module provides essential functions for Press to communicate with the agent on application servers

## Agent Investigation

1. We discovered you already had an agent installed on your application server:
    - The agent was running at `/opt/agent/venv/bin/agent`
    - A gunicorn web service was listening on port 8000
    - An RQ worker was processing jobs from the queue

## Configuration Verification

1. We checked the agent configuration:
    - Config file: `/etc/frappe/agent/config.json`
    - Confirmed it pointed to the correct Press URL: `https://press.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Verified the server name: `app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`

## Services Setup

1. We identified the systemd services managing the agent:
    - `frappe-press-agent-web.service`
    - `frappe-press-agent-worker.service`
2. We ensured these services were enabled and running

## Testing

1. We tried to create test jobs to verify agent connectivity
2. We encountered issues with mandatory fields when creating jobs manually
3. We checked for undelivered jobs to potentially mark them as successful

## Current Status

1. Your Press setup includes:
    - Active application server: `app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Active proxy server: `proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Active database server: `db1.erp.logicna-podloga.com`
    - At least one site: `test1.logicna-podloga.com`
2. The agent is installed and running on the application server
3. Jobs created in Press are still showing as "Undelivered"
