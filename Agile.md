What is MVP

-MVP is an acronym for Minimum Viable Product. It basically means keep it simple!!! 
-Don't build a Ferrari if all you need is a skateboard! 
-A lot of times people over complicate things in projects and sometimes end up in never ending cycles of finding the "perfect" solution. 
-Agile, encourages you to build the minimum you really need (without compromising quality of course) and then iterating over time. 

User Story Template
In theory, user stories are basically product features, requirements or tasks that add value to the end customer. 
In practice, most Agile Teams use user stories as tasks that reflect what they are trying to accomplish, which of course is directed to meeting a customer need or requirement.

In theory they should be written like this:
As a <user> (who) I want to… <what> so that… <why>
Example: As a front end developer I need to ensure the app is responsive so that it can work on different screen sizes

But using the format above to write user stories, requires more effort and space (which is limited if you're using post-it notes). Plus it can get a bit repetitive and redundant, so…

In practice, most Agile Teams write user stories as short tasks which start with a verb
<verb> and the task that is being performed (written in a short and concise manner)
Example: Ensure the app is responsive so that it can work on different screen sizes

Examples of verbs to start a user story would be:
Create
Develop
Build
Plan
Research
Perform
Test


Key concepts

User Stories
• As a <user> (who) I want... <what> so that... <why>
• + story points + acceptance criteria. Should be independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable,
sized appropriately, testable (INVEST).

Story points
• Story points are a relative unit of measure to assess whether a user story is big or small. You
can use different scales for story points (e.g. 1, 3 or 5 ; t-shirt sizes s, m, l, xl, xxl).

Product Backlog
• An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product (also known as Master
Story List).

Sprint Backlog
• The set of Backlog items selected to be delivered over a period of time.

Velocity
• The number of story points delivered over a sprint.

Swimlanes
• A visual representation of stories (y axis) vs. status on the kanban/agile board: To Do; Doing;
Done (x axis). Swimlanes let the team see progress on individual stories, while highlighting
specific areas that need attention.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
• The bare minimum product that meets the client’s expectations. Includes all must haves and
excludes all nice to haves (no bells and whistles).

Release
• Comprised of several iterations or sprints.

Sprint
• A period of time in which the team will work on a defined set of user stories.
