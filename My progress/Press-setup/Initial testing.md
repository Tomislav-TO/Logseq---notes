## Initial Problem Discovery

1. You had set up a Press installation (press.logicna-podloga.com) and created servers, benches, apps, and sites
2. Actions in Press were creating jobs, but they remained in "Undelivered" status
3. The root cause was identified as a missing `agent.py` module in your Press installation

## Fix Implementation

1. We created a custom `agent.py` module in the correct location:
    - Path: `/home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/press/press/api/agent.py`
    - This module provides essential functions for Press to communicate with the agent on application servers

## Agent Investigation

1. We discovered you already had an agent installed on your application server:
    - The agent was running at `/opt/agent/venv/bin/agent`
    - A gunicorn web service was listening on port 8000
    - An RQ worker was processing jobs from the queue

## Configuration Verification

1. We checked the agent configuration:
    - Config file: `/etc/frappe/agent/config.json`
    - Confirmed it pointed to the correct Press URL: `https://press.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Verified the server name: `app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`

## Services Setup

1. We identified the systemd services managing the agent:
    - `frappe-press-agent-web.service`
    - `frappe-press-agent-worker.service`
2. We ensured these services were enabled and running

## Testing

1. We tried to create test jobs to verify agent connectivity
2. We encountered issues with mandatory fields when creating jobs manually
3. We checked for undelivered jobs to potentially mark them as successful

## Current Status

1. Your Press setup includes:
    - Active application server: `app1.proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Active proxy server: `proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
    - Active database server: `db1.erp.logicna-podloga.com`
    - At least one site: `test1.logicna-podloga.com`
2. The agent is installed and running on the application server
3. Jobs created in Press are still showing as "Undelivered"
