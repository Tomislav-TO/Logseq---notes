- **Hours Worked**
  **Start Time:** ~10:00 -
- **End Time:** 18:30
- **Total Hours:** 8.5
- ## **Tasks Completed**
- **Successfully diagnosed Press certificate corruption issue**
	- Identified that Press Agent was writing truncated certificates with "...truncated..." placeholder text
	- Root cause: Press only supports AWS Route53 for automated certificates, but setup uses Cloudflare
	- Resolved NGINX startup failures by replacing corrupted certificates with valid self-signed ones
- **Fixed multiple server setup failures**
	- Resolved n1 proxy server stuck in "Installing" status
	- Fixed MariaDB authentication issues on database server (d1.logicna-podloga.com)
	- Corrected SSL certificate path conflicts preventing NGINX reload
- **Established working server infrastructure**
	- **Press Server:** 91.99.3.15 (press.logicna-podloga.com) - Active âœ…
	- **Proxy Server:** 157.90.153.89 (n1.logicna-podloga.com) - Working NGINX âœ…
	- **Database Server:** 188.34.178.204 (d1.logicna-podloga.com) - MariaDB configured âœ…
- **DNS configuration verification**
	- Confirmed Cloudflare DNS records pointing to correct server IPs
	- Validated SSH connectivity using domain names
	- Verified wildcard certificate exists in Press database
- **Created comprehensive backup strategy**
	- Successfully backed up complete Press application (database + files)
	- Timestamp: 20250529_183250 (3.2MiB database, config, public/private files)
	- Prepared server configuration backup procedures
- ## **Tasks in Progress**
- **Task 1: Complete Press Server Infrastructure Setup**
	- **Description:** Finalizing Press platform with working proxy, database, and app servers
	- **Current Status:** Core servers operational, certificate management needs long-term solution
- ## **Challenges**
- **Certificate Management Incompatibility:** Press expects AWS Route53 for automated Let's Encrypt certificates, but infrastructure uses Cloudflare DNS
- **Corrupted Certificate Generation:** Press Agent consistently corrupts certificate files during setup, writing placeholder text instead of actual certificate data
- **Multi-Server Complexity:** Managing certificates across 3 separate servers (Press, Proxy, Database) with different IP addresses
- **MariaDB Authentication:** Database server had no root password set, causing Press setup authentication failures
- ## **Code Review**
  
  **PRs Submitted:** None (Infrastructure/DevOps work)
- ## **Meetings**
- **[Press Infrastructure Setup & Troubleshooting Session]**
	- **Duration:** 8.5 hours
	- **Topics Covered:**
		- Press platform architecture (multi-server setup)
		- SSL/TLS certificate management and Let's Encrypt integration
		- NGINX configuration troubleshooting
		- MariaDB authentication and password management
		- DNS configuration with Cloudflare + Hetzner servers
		- Press backup and restoration procedures
- ## **Blockers**
  
  **Issues:**
- Press certificate automation incompatible with Cloudflare DNS (only supports AWS Route53)
- Press Agent has persistent bug corrupting certificate files during generation
- Long-term certificate renewal strategy needed (manual vs automated)
  
  **Action Taken/Needed:**
- Implemented temporary self-signed certificates to resolve immediate NGINX failures
- Documented certificate corruption issue for potential bug report to Frappe
- **Still needed:** Implement sustainable certificate management solution (Cloudflare API integration or manual renewal process)
- ## **Tomorrow's Plan**
- Implement long-term certificate solution using Cloudflare API with certbot-dns-cloudflare
- Complete Press server setup with proper Let's Encrypt certificates
- Test full Press functionality with working SSL certificates across all servers
- Document final working configuration for future reference
- ## **Notes & Learnings**
- Press platform has limited DNS provider support (AWS Route53 only) causing certificate issues with other providers
- Certificate corruption appears to be a Press Agent bug when using unsupported DNS providers
- Hetzner + Cloudflare + Press combination works but requires manual certificate management
- Press backup system is robust and includes complete application data + files
- Multi-server Press setup requires careful coordination of certificates across all nodes
- ## **Resources Used**
- Press platform documentation and GitHub issues research
- OpenSSL certificate debugging and generation tools
- NGINX configuration troubleshooting and testing
- MariaDB authentication and user management
- Cloudflare DNS management and API token creation
- Press bench backup and restoration procedures
- SSH/SCP for multi-server file management
