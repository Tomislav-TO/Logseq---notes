- ## **ðŸ“‹ DAILY WORK LOG**
  
  **Hours Worked:** 5 hours (14:00 - 19:00)
- ### **Tasks Completed**
- Diagnosed Press server communication issues with application server
- Found agent was installed but not talking to our Press instance
- Discovered agent was pointing to frappecloud.com instead of our press.logicna-podloga.com
- Identified password mismatch between Press and agent
- Cleared some stuck agent jobs in the system
- ### **What I Found**
- Agent is running fine on port 25052
- Problem is just config - agent thinks it should talk to official Frappe Cloud
- All our servers (proxy, app, database) are working properly
- Just need to update one config file to point agent to our Press
- ### **Tomorrow's Plan**
- Fix the agent config to point to our Press instance
- Test that Press can properly manage the application server
- Continue Python course
- ### **Blockers**
- Agent config still pointing to wrong Press URL (fix ready)
- ### **Tools Used**
- Claude AI for troubleshooting
- SSH to check server configs
- Press dashboard for diagnostics
  
  **Status:** Ready to complete the agent setup tomorrow
