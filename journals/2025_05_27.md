- **Hours Worked**
  **Start Time:** 10:00 - **End Time:** 16:00 **Total Hours:** 6
- ### Tasks Completed
- Successfully identified and diagnosed multiple Press platform UI bugs preventing bench creation
- Fixed agent connectivity issues by opening firewall port 25052 and binding agent to external interface (0.0.0.0)
- Updated server configuration to use public IP (188.245.56.6) instead of unreachable private IP (10.0.0.5)
- Created bench via backend console bypassing broken UI (`bench-0002-000001-a1`)
- Configured agent to communicate with correct Press server URL (press.logicna-podloga.com)
- ### Tasks in Progress
- **Task 1: Complete ERPNext Production Deployment**
	- **Description:** Setting up full ERPNext production environment with Press platform including servers, benches, and sites
	- **Current Status:** Bench created successfully, agent authentication still failing despite token synchronization
- ### Challenges
- **Press UI Bugs:** Multiple UI validation errors preventing normal bench/site creation through dashboard
- **Network Connectivity:** Agent bound to localhost preventing Press server communication
- **Authentication Mismatch:** Press and agent using different authentication tokens causing "Unauthenticated" errors
- **Private vs Public IP:** Press configured to use unreachable private network addresses
- ### Code Review
  
  **PRs Submitted:** None
- ### Meetings
- **[Technical troubleshooting session with Claude]**
	- **Duration:** 6 hours
	- **Topics Covered:**
		- Press platform architecture and configuration
		- Agent-server communication protocols
		- Network troubleshooting and firewall configuration
		- Database console operations and authentication token management
- ### Blockers
  
  **Issues:** Agent authentication failing despite token synchronization
- Press UI contains multiple validation bugs preventing normal workflow
- Agent jobs remaining "Undelivered" status preventing bench deployment
- Authentication token format mismatch between Press server and agent
  
  **Action Taken/Needed:**
- Bypassed UI bugs using backend console commands
- Fixed network connectivity and firewall rules
- Synchronized authentication tokens between Press and agent
- **Still needed:** Resolve final authentication protocol mismatch
- ### Tomorrow's Plan
- Resolve agent authentication protocol (test different auth formats)
- Complete bench deployment process once authentication works
- Create and configure ERPNext sites on deployed bench
- Test full ERPNext functionality in production environment
- ### Notes & Learnings
- Press platform has significant UI bugs that require backend console workarounds
- Agent communication requires both network connectivity AND proper authentication token sync
- Hetzner + Cloudflare setup works but requires careful IP configuration (public vs private)
- Press uses complex authentication protocols that may differ from standard Basic Auth
- ### Resources Used
- Press platform documentation and source code analysis
- Agent configuration files and authentication mechanisms
- Database console operations for bypassing UI limitations
- Network troubleshooting tools (curl, netstat, firewall management)
