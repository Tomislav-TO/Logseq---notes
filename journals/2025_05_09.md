- ## Notes & Learnings
- ****:
- **SSH Authentication Requirements**:
- Press requires SSH key authentication for the `frappe` user
- Both the `root` and `frappe` users need proper SSH access configured
- **Server Communication Requirements**:
- Server hostnames must resolve to the correct IPs
- Both directions of communication are important (Press -> Server and Server -> Press)
- **UI Limitations**:
- The Press interface can encounter issues that don't provide clear error information
- Console access provides more direct control and better error visibility
- **Component-by-Component Approach**:
- Breaking down server setup into individual components can bypass full setup issues
- Core components (SSH, Nginx) can be set up separately and still provide functionality
