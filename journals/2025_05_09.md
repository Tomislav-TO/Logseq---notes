  **Issue:**
	- **DNS Resolution Issue**: When trying to set up the proxy server, DNS was resolving to Cloudflare IPs instead of the actual server IP
	- **SSH Authentication Failure**: Press couldn't connect to the proxy server via SSH
	- Press interface actions (Ping, Setup Server) were failing immediately
	- Ansible plays were showing failure status:
- **Action Taken/Needed:**
	- **Fixed DNS Configuration**:
		- Added a specific DNS record for proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com in Cloudflare
		- Set it to "DNS only" (gray cloud) instead of "Proxied" (orange cloud)
		- This allowed direct communication with the actual server IP
	- **Set Up SSH Authentication**:
		- Generated SSH keys on the Press server: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
		- Configured the `frappe` user on the proxy server with SSH key authentication
		- Verified SSH connection worked: `ssh frappe@proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
		- Verified Ansible connectivity: `ansible -i "proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com," -m ping proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
	- **Hosts File Configuration**:
		- Added an entry in the proxy server's hosts file: `91.99.3.15 press.logicna-podloga.com`
		- This ensured the proxy server could communicate directly with the Press server
- ## Tomorrowâ€™s Plan
- **Setup proxy and application servers**
	- 2. Application Server Setup
		- Identified that a new server would need to be provisioned in Hetzner first
		- Paused setup until proper authorization and server allocation could be secured
		- Prepared for later setup by identifying required configuration:
			- Would need SSH key authentication set up like the proxy server
			- Would need to be connected to both proxy and database servers
			- Would need proper hostname and domain configuration
- **Study Frappe School**
- ## Notes & Learnings
- **DNS Configuration Impact**:
- Cloudflare proxy mode can interfere with server-to-server communication
- Direct DNS resolution is crucial for proper server setup
- **SSH Authentication Requirements**:
- Press requires SSH key authentication for the `frappe` user
- Both the `root` and `frappe` users need proper SSH access configured
- **Server Communication Requirements**:
- Server hostnames must resolve to the correct IPs
- Both directions of communication are important (Press -> Server and Server -> Press)
- **UI Limitations**:
- The Press interface can encounter issues that don't provide clear error information
- Console access provides more direct control and better error visibility
- **Component-by-Component Approach**:
- Breaking down server setup into individual components can bypass full setup issues
- Core components (SSH, Nginx) can be set up separately and still provide functionality
