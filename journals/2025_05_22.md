- # Tasks Completed
  
  **Infrastructure validation and setup**
- Confirmed Ubuntu 22.04 compatibility with Press Ansible automation
- Successfully deployed external database architecture (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Migrated Press database from local to external server configuration
  
  **Proxy server deployment**
- Set up Ubuntu 22.04 proxy server (157.90.153.89)
- Completed full agent installation and configuration
- Achieved "Active" proxy server status in Press dashboard
  
  **SSL certificate troubleshooting and resolution**
- Identified Press SSL certificate generation bug (corrupted 77-byte PEM files)
- Researched community evidence of SSL automation issues
- Implemented multiple debugging attempts within Press system
  
  **Production SSL implementation**
- Deployed Let's Encrypt certificates for production-grade SSL
- Configured external SSL termination (industry standard approach)
- Set up automatic certificate renewal with cron job
- Implemented security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
  
  **Database architecture migration**
- Configured external database server (188.34.178.204 / 10.0.0.2)
- Created proper MySQL users and permissions for remote access
- Successfully migrated Press database with full data integrity
- Validated external database connectivity and performance
-
- # Tasks in Progress
  
  **Database server setup** - Configure additional database server for complete production architecture
  **Documentation creation** - Document production deployment procedures and limitations
  
  **Description**
  Completed comprehensive Press infrastructure deployment with external database architecture and production-grade SSL implementation. Successfully resolved Ubuntu compatibility issues and Press SSL automation limitations through industry-standard workarounds. Achieved fully operational proxy server with enterprise security compliance.
-
- # Challenges
- **Press SSL certificate corruption** - Generated malformed 77-byte PEM files instead of proper certificates
- **Agent configuration conflicts** - Multiple nginx configs interfering with SSL setup
- **Certificate regeneration loop** - Agent continuously overwrote fixed SSL configurations
- **Symlink management complexity** - Agent using symlinks that caused configuration conflicts
- **Git repository ownership** - Permission issues preventing agent updates during setup
-
- # Code Review
  **Configuration files modified:**
- nginx SSL termination configuration
- Let's Encrypt certificate integration
- Agent template modifications for HTTP-only operation
- Production security headers implementation
-
- # Meetings
  **[Infrastructure architecture planning with Claude]** Duration: 8 hours
- Press SSL automation limitation analysis and workaround strategies
- External database migration planning and execution
- Production SSL implementation using Let's Encrypt
- Security compliance and enterprise architecture best practices
- Agent configuration debugging and resolution
-
- # Blockers
  
  **Issues resolved:**
- âœ… **Press SSL certificate generation** - Bypassed with external Let's Encrypt implementation
- âœ… **Nginx configuration conflicts** - Resolved by disabling conflicting agent configs
- âœ… **Agent setup completion** - Achieved through HTTP-only template modification
- âœ… **Database connectivity** - Successfully configured external database access
- âœ… **Certificate corruption** - Implemented external SSL management
-
- # Action Taken/Needed:
- **Implemented production SSL architecture** with Let's Encrypt and auto-renewal
- **Configured external database separation** for scalability and maintainability
- **Documented Press SSL limitations** for future deployments
- **Achieved proxy server "Active" status** with full functionality
- **Next**: Configure additional database server and finalize production architecture
-
- # Tomorrow's Plan
- **Complete database server setup** for the new Hetzner database server
- **Test bench and site creation** functionality through the proxy
- **Validate complete production workflow** end-to-end
- **Create deployment documentation** for future Press infrastructure setups
-
- # Notes & Learnings
- **Press SSL automation is unreliable** - External SSL management required for production
- **Ubuntu 22.04 essential** for Press compatibility (24.04 has Ansible issues)
- **External database architecture works excellently** - Proven scalable approach
- **Let's Encrypt integration successful** - Industry standard for production SSL
- **Agent HTTP/HTTPS hybrid approach** - Maintains Press functionality with security
- **Manual SSL configuration is normal** for production Press deployments (community evidence)
-
- # Resources Used
- Hetzner Cloud Console for server deployment and management
- Let's Encrypt/Certbot documentation for SSL certificate automation
- nginx configuration documentation for SSL termination setup
- Press agent source code analysis for template modification
- Community forums for Press SSL limitation research and validation
