  **Issue:**
	- **DNS Resolution Issue**: When trying to set up the proxy server, DNS was resolving to Cloudflare IPs instead of the actual server IP
	- **SSH Authentication Failure**: Press couldn't connect to the proxy server via SSH
- **Action Taken/Needed:**
	- Created ssh for proxy server so i can ssh into it from press and get connection
	- removed unreachable error when running setup server
	- add another records in DNS cloudflare so press can reach proxy
	- Changed configuration so ip of proxy server is more reachable
- ## Tomorrowâ€™s Plan
- **Setup proxy and application servers**
	- try to properly install server with setup server and activate it
	- run application servers
