- ## Blockers
  
  **Issue:**
	- **DNS Resolution Issue**: When trying to set up the proxy server, DNS was resolving to Cloudflare IPs instead of the actual server IP
	- **SSH Authentication Failure**: Press couldn't connect to the proxy server via SSH
	- Press interface actions (Ping, Setup Server) were failing immediately
	- Ansible plays were showing failure status:
- **Action Taken/Needed:**
	- **Fixed DNS Configuration**:
		- Added a specific DNS record for proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com in Cloudflare
		- Set it to "DNS only" (gray cloud) instead of "Proxied" (orange cloud)
		- This allowed direct communication with the actual server IP
	- **Set Up SSH Authentication**:
		- Generated SSH keys on the Press server: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
		- Configured the `frappe` user on the proxy server with SSH key authentication
		- Verified SSH connection worked: `ssh frappe@proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
		- Verified Ansible connectivity: `ansible -i "proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com," -m ping proxy3.production.logicna-podloga.com`
	- **Hosts File Configuration**:
		- Added an entry in the proxy server's hosts file: `91.99.3.15 press.logicna-podloga.com`
		- This ensured the proxy server could communicate directly with the Press server
- ## Tomorrowâ€™s Plan
- **Setup proxy and application servers**
	- try to properly install server with setup server and activate it
	- run application servers
- Study Frappe School
- ## Notes & Learnings
- We need specific record in cloudflare for proxy and press conenction
- Additional options on press application in UI
