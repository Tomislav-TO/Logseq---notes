- **Start Time:** ~9:00
- **End Time:** ~14:00
- **Total Hours:** 4
- ## **ðŸ“‹ DAILY WORK LOG**
- ### **Tasks Completed**
- Investigated Press deployment stuck at "Install Essential Packages" step (6th build step)
- Analyzed Agent Job creation and processing pipeline between Press and Application servers
- Diagnosed server record configuration issues (missing Server Type field)
- Traced deployment flow from Deploy Candidate Build â†’ Agent Jobs â†’ Redis queue â†’ RQ workers
- Discovered authentication mismatch between Press server and Application server agent
- Tested Agent Job enqueueing and HTTP communication between servers
- Validated Redis queue status and RQ worker health on application server
- Identified root cause: HTTP 401 authentication failures preventing job processing
-
- ### **What I Found**
- **Agent Jobs ARE being created successfully** - both Ping Jobs and Run Remote Builder jobs exist
- **Ping Jobs work perfectly** (Status: Success) but Build Jobs stuck at Pending
- **Redis queue completely empty** - jobs never reach application server due to auth rejection
- **3 healthy RQ workers** listening on Redis queues (high, default, low)
- **Authentication mismatch**: Press uses `agent_password` (32 chars) but Agent expects `access_token` (pbkdf2 hashed)
- **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** responses when Press tries to send jobs to agent endpoint
- **Deploy Candidate Build contains proper Docker build instructions** for frappe+erpnext
- **Server connectivity works** (ping, basic HTTP responses) but job submission fails
-
- ### **Tomorrow's Plan**
- Fix agent password mismatch in Press server configuration
- Update Press to use correct access_token from agent config.json
- Test Agent Job submission after authentication fix
- Monitor Redis queue to confirm jobs reach application server
- Verify Docker build process starts and completes successfully
- Continue with full deployment pipeline testing
-
- ### **Blockers**
- **Authentication mismatch preventing all Docker build jobs from processing**
- Agent rejects HTTP requests with 401 Unauthorized despite successful ping tests
- Build pipeline completely blocked until agent authentication is resolved
-
- ### **Tools Used**
- Claude AI for systematic Agent Job pipeline analysis
- SSH access to both Press server and Application server
- Redis CLI for queue inspection and job monitoring
- curl for HTTP endpoint testing and authentication debugging
- Press dashboard for Agent Job status tracking
- Python scripts for Frappe DocType investigation and data analysis
-
- ### **Technical Deep Dive**
- **Agent Jobs Created**: 26 total, including recent Run Remote Builder jobs
- **Authentication Method**: Agent expects Basic Auth with pbkdf2-sha256 hashed token
- **Queue Status**: Redis queues (high/default/low) all empty despite job creation
- **Worker Status**: 3 RQ workers healthy and listening for jobs
- **Communication Flow**: Press â†’ HTTP POST â†’ Agent â†’ Redis â†’ RQ Workers (fails at HTTP POST)
  
  **Status:** Root cause identified - authentication mismatch blocking all build job processing ðŸ”§

- **ðŸ“‹ DAILY WORK LOG**
  
  **Tasks Completed**
- Diagnosed Press deployment system stuck on "Scheduling" status
- Fixed server callback configuration (enabled use_agent_job_callbacks)
- Investigated crashed scheduler preventing deployment job processing
- Fixed malformed apps.txt file missing 'agent' application
- Corrected apps.txt file location (moved from sites/ to bench root directory)
- Analyzed supervisor configuration differences between system and local configs
  
  **What I Found**
- Build server and worker queues are configured correctly
- Callback system was disabled, now enabled to match global Press settings
- Scheduler crashes due to apps.txt file issues (missing agent app, wrong location)
- Standard Press setup expects apps.txt in bench root, not sites directory
- Deploy candidates exist but can't be processed due to scheduler being down
  
  **Tomorrow's Plan**
- Investigate remaining scheduler crash after apps.txt fixes
- Test deployment process once scheduler is working
- Verify full deployment pipeline from candidate creation to site deployment
- Continue with site creation and testing
  
  **Blockers**
- Scheduler still crashing despite apps.txt fixes (needs error log analysis)
- Deployments cannot proceed until scheduler is operational
  
  **Tools Used**
- Claude AI for systematic troubleshooting
- SSH server access for configuration analysis
- Press dashboard for deployment monitoring
- Supervisor control for service management
  
  **Status:** Scheduler configuration issues partially resolved, final error investigation needed ðŸ”§
