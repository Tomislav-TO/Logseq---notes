- **Hours Worked:** 4 hours (14:00 - 18:00)
  
  **ðŸ“‹ DAILY WORK LOG**
  
  **Tasks Completed**
- Diagnosed Press deployment system stuck on "Scheduling" status
- Fixed server callback configuration (enabled use_agent_job_callbacks)
- Investigated crashed scheduler preventing deployment job processing
- Fixed malformed apps.txt file missing 'agent' application
- Corrected apps.txt file location (moved from sites/ to bench root directory)
- Analyzed supervisor configuration differences between system and local configs
  
  **What I Found**
- Build server and worker queues are configured correctly
- Callback system was disabled, now enabled to match global Press settings
- Scheduler crashes due to apps.txt file issues (missing agent app, wrong location)
- Standard Press setup expects apps.txt in bench root, not sites directory
- Deploy candidates exist but can't be processed due to scheduler being down
  
  **Tomorrow's Plan**
- Investigate remaining scheduler crash after apps.txt fixes
- Test deployment process once scheduler is working
- Verify full deployment pipeline from candidate creation to site deployment
- Continue with site creation and testing
  
  **Blockers**
- Scheduler still crashing despite apps.txt fixes (needs error log analysis)
- Deployments cannot proceed until scheduler is operational
  
  **Tools Used**
- Claude AI for systematic troubleshooting
- SSH server access for configuration analysis
- Press dashboard for deployment monitoring
- Supervisor control for service management
  
  **Status:** Scheduler configuration issues partially resolved, final error investigation needed ðŸ”§
